Auvik technical assessment

Imagine that we are writing a tool that analyses log files to allow investigators perform forensic
analysis on attacked servers. We plan to use this tool to perform different types of analysis but
for now the only information that we want to get is the top 10 countries that try to brute force the
SSH server.

You can use the file in http://www.secrepo.com/auth.log/auth.log.gz as input. To determine the
country from the attacking IP you can use any freely available Geolocation address database.
The application should allow the user to specify a time range so only log messages within the
time range are considered.

Writing your solution using the Go programming language is preferred but you can use any
language you feel comfortable with. Code should be performant, extensible, maintainable and
robust.

Please send the code as a bundled local git repository (git bundle)
