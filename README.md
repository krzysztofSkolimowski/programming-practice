# Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges and exercises, mostly focused on solving
interview problems like LeetCode and "Cracking the Coding Interview". The solutions are implemented in Go programming
language.

## Contents

The repository contains the following folders:

- `leetcode`: contains solutions to problems from LeetCode
- `cracking-the-coding-interview`: contains solutions to problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview, Edition 6"

Each folder contains a subfolder for each problem, with the solution code and a brief description of the problem and the
solution.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you need to have the Go programming environment set up on your machine.
The solutions are written in Go.

Once you have the environment set up, you can run the solution by running the testcase in the test-file
with `_test.go` ending
